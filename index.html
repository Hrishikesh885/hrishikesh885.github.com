<h3>ABOUT THIS SITE:- </h3>

<p>My aim is to create a site to display basic concepts of programming and problems related to it and for us to address them together.This will greatly help us to improve our skills. 
The information written is best to my knowledge.</p>
</article>
</div>
<p> Basic concepts and definitions are explained below:- </p>
<div class="grammar">
<article>
It is important to understand the grammar as programming is also a language and can not be understood without it.
Grammar of programming :-
<ul>
<li>THE PARENTHESES i.e brackets - They mark a block in the code even they are of different types.The curly braces '{ }',these are the most
prominent ones and mark a block in the code.The next are curve or circular braces'( )',these are used to hold or contain the condition
statements of a loop statement ,they are used after the functions and methods to show whether they have an argument within them.
The last is the square bracket'[]',these are used to hold the elements and declare an array. </li>
<li>THE SEMICOLON ';' - This is the most important symbol in the programming language as it acts like a fulll stop.It is 
to be used after the end of each and every line of code or statement but be carefull as if you use it after any loop or method 
then that particular method or loop won't execute and it will give you an error.But it is not used in Python.</li>
<li>COMMENTS '//' '/**/' - Commments are meant for you refernce only and do not hold any place in the code.Compiler does not read itand complletely ignores it.Single line comment is // 
multiple line is /**/.</li>
</ul>

<div class="class">
<header><h3>CLASS:- </h3></header>
<p>A class is a group of objects that shares common properties.It contains methods or functions which are refered by one which is user defined.
   In turbo c++ we can declare a class but it is not neccessary,but it is important and compulsory in Java.
   </p>

</div>
<div class="if">
<article>IF:- 
<p>The if statement is used as a condition statement to execute a set/block/segment of code which completes the given requirement.
Its offshoots are nested if-else and ladder if-else but the basic concept is same an to understand how it executes you need to pay attention too the brackets.
The location of the brackets seperates the nested if-else from ladder if-else.</p></article>

NOTE:- As mentioned in the grammar do not place a semi-colon after if.

<div class="switch">
<article>SWITCH STATEMENT:-
<p>The switch statement is used to perform various tasks using cases depending upon value of a variable or expression. It is
known as multiple branching statement or user choice statement.We use switch statement when we have different types of operations
to be performed based on the choice given by the user.ITS A MENU DRIVEN PROGRAM.
Some terms of switch:- 
<ul>
<li>SWITCH - The switch statemnt executes the case corresponding to the value of the value of the expression/constant/choice selected.</li>
<li>CASE - The case keyword is follow by an integer constant or a character constant and a colon ( : ) symbol followed by one or more valid statements.</li>
<li>BREAK - The break statement causes the termination  of execution of the particular statement(s) given after the closing brace of a switch.If there is 
no break,the execution flows through and executes all the cases till the control gets a break statement.This situation is known as 'FALL THROUGH'.</li>
<li>DEFAULT - Equivalent of else in if-else but for switch only.Written after the last case.Executes if none of the conditions are met.
</ul>

NOTE:- The nested switch and ladder switch is same to nested if an dladder if so not explaining it.

<div class="for">
<article>FOR LOOP:- 
<p>The for loop allows a set of statements to be repeated or looped through a fixed number of times.The bracket contains initializers;conditional test;update statement.</p>
